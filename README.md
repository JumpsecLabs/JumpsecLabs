## Local Development

Pre-requisites: [Git 竊余(https://git-scm.com), [Docker 竊余(https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

git pull origin main
```

### 2. (Optional) Configure the environment

You can edit the `dev.env` file to change the dev server behaviour,
the following environment variables are available:

* `HUGO_VERSION` is the Hugo release version to use (default: same as deploy version).
* `HUGO_PORT` is the port the local server will listen on (default: 9000).
* `HUGO_UID` is the UID that the dev server process will be run as (default: 1000).
* `HUGO_GID` is the GID that the dev server process will be run as (default: 1000).

### 3. Start the development server

The dev environment uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```sh
cd JumpsecLabs

docker compose --env-file dev.env up --build
```

Once running, with default settings, the Labs website will be available
at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).
