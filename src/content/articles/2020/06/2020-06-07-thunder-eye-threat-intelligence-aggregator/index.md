The project currently code-named Thunder Eye is a threat intelligence aggregator that will act as an internal and external search engine for a variety of intelligence purposes. It will collect and store data varying from vulnerability scans, DNS data, breach lists, torrent sites, honeypot networks, and some manually inserted data sourced from our threat hunting and incident response/SOC investigations. It allows our internal team and our clients to benefit from a broad range of data corresponding to their threat landscape the same way an attacker would, enabling us and our clients to defeat cyber attacks as part of usual business processes.
