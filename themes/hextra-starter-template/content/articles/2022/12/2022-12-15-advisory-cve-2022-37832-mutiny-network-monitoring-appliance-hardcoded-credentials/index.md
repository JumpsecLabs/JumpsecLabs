**Software:** Mutiny Network Monitoring Appliance

**Affected versions:** <= 7.2.0-10855

**Vendor page:** www.mutiny.com

**CVE Reference:** CVE-2022-37832

**Published:** 16/12/2022

**CVSS 3.1 Score:** 10.0 AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Attack Vector:** Network

**Credit:** Ryan Saridar

**Summary**

An attacker can log in as root remotely to the appliance via SSH.

**Mitigation**

Upgrade to version 7.2.0-10855 onwards to remediate the problem.

**Technical details**

Before version 7.2.0-10855, the SSH service allows password login to the appliance. The use of weak, hardcoded root credentials between versions means that an attacker with knowledge of this fixed password can log into the appliance remotely and gain unrestricted access to it. Between version 7.2.0-10788 and up to 7.2.0-10850, key-based authentication was introduced, however password-based authentication was not yet disabled. On the patched version, key-based authentication is enforced.
